High-fidelity simulations are conducted to accrurately predict the aerodynamics around iced wings and to unveil the dominant flow mechnisms in iced wing flows. We leverage proportional orthogonal decomposition (POD) to extract the dominant flow structures, and analyze the vortex motions in ice-induced separated shear layer and the acoustic resonance around iced slats. Also, we inspect the effects of wing tip vortex and end-wall interactions.
